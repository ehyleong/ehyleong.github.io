        <h5>A bit more about me</h5>
      </div>
    <div class="col-lg-7 col-lg-offset-1 col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 col-xs-12">
      <p>In 2012, I graduated from <strong>Emily Carr University of Art + Design</strong>, with a Bachelor's in Communication Design. I started my career doing graphic design for an indie film studio, and since then have designed brand identities, illustrations, websites, and interfaces for agencies, in-house teams, and via freelance.</p>
      <p> As of late, my focus has been in <strong>digital product design</strong>. I currently work as a senior designer at a software development studio called <strong><a href="https://steamclock.com" class="inline-link">Steamclock Software</a></strong>, where I lead design on predominantly consumer-facing mobile apps for a range of clients, as well as internal brand & marketing projects.</p>
      <p>By nature, I consider myself a craftsperson that cares about getting the details right – whether it’s the copy of a CTA, the bezier curve of micro-animation, or kerning on a wordmark. But as much as I take my work seriously, I also like to play and have fun. Life’s too short to be an asshole, afterall.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, you'll likely find me drawing, snowboarding, dodgeball, or playing boardgames with my partner. I'm also a huge nerd when it comes to escape rooms. (What can I say, I really love creative problem solving.)</p>
