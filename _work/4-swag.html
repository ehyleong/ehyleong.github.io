intro: Bespoke prints designed with love
byline: At Steamclock, it became an annual tradition to make custom notebooks and holiday cards for staff and clients. Much to my delight, as the team's sole designer with illustration chops and a print design background, the execution of these often came down to me. We primarily partnered with our friends at <a href="https://porchlightpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Porchlight Press</strong></a> to print our swag using letterpress and foil stamping.
