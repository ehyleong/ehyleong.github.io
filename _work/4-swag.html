intro: I spearheaded several in-house print projects, including letterpressed and foil stamped notebooks and cards.
byline: At Steamclock, it became an annual tradition to make bespoke notebooks and holiday cards for staff and clients. And as the team's sole visual designer with a print design background, the execution of these often came down to me – much to my delight.

				<h5>2022 Notebooks</h5>
					<p>The theme for 2022 was Stay Curious. After brainstorming various ways to convey curiosity, we landed on making a museum of crafted curios – loaded with a bunch of fun, interesting items and easter eggs.</p>
					<br><br><p>These were printed with metallic purple foil stamp on cobblestone grey vellum, sewn saddle stitch binding.</p>
