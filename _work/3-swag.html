intro: Bespoke prints designed with&nbsp;love.
byline: At Steamclock, it became an annual tradition to make bespoke notebooks and holiday cards for staff and clients. As the team's sole designer with an illustration and graphic design background, the execution of these often came down to me (to my delight). We often partnered with our local friends at <a href="https://porchlightpress.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><strong>Porchlight Press</strong></a>, known for their commitment to quality.

				<p>2019 was the first year we decided to invest in doing letterpress for our holiday cards. No particular theme or brief, aside from channeling holiday spirit from a local tech company. These were printed with two-colour letterpress on white cotton stock.</p></div>
