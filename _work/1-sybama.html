intro: A cheeky checklist for curious clients.
byline: At Steamclock, we got a lot of requests for mobile apps. But not every business needs one – so we made a simple microsite to help prospective clients (and non-clients) figure out if they really need a mobile app, via a fun & interactive checklist.

			<h3>Most products should start with a mobile web experience. However, alot of businesses who approach Steamclock don't know that.</h3>
			<p>In the spring of 2021, our small but mighty design team had a few weeks in between client work to come up with a fun marketing side project. The goals were to make something entertaining, shareable, and appealing to our largely product/tech audience, while also communicating Steamclock's value proposition of <strong>building high quality mobile apps for growing businesses.</strong>  What a fun challenge it was.

			<h5 class="half-spacer">The Concept</h5>
			<p>After a high-level brainstorming session with the team, I then further ideated and wireframed a bunch of concepts. Some were more silly than others – but we ultimately landed with <a href="https://shouldyoubuildamobile.app/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">"Should You Build a Mobile App"</a>, a microsite with a contrarian message. Instead of trying to convince product teams that they needed a mobile app, we aimed for the opposite: <strong>don't build a mobile app, unless there's a solid business case for it.</strong></p>

			<h5>The Outcome</h5>

			<p> To help prospects determine if their business case was strong enough, we made an interactive checklist with various valid reasons for building an app. Things like: push notifications, retaining users, communicating with hardware, keeping people logged in – all that fine jazz.</p>

			<p> With some copy from our co-founder/resident wordsmith Allen, I designed and prototyped the website from wireframes to high-fidelity visuals using Figma, before handing things off to our designer-developer Brady to build the static site on Jekyll. I also used a super combo of Figma, Illustrator, and After Effects to make a Lottie animation for each checklist item, for some added delight and polish.

			<p>After a couple weeks of further experimentation, iteration, and refinement, we shipped. Overall, the project was a success! People loved it, shared it, and new clients have even referenced it while reaching out. And as an added bonus, we even use it to screen our in-bound leads too.</p>
