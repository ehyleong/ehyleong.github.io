intro: I spearheaded several print projects for Steamclock's employees and clients.
byline: At Steamclock, it became an annual tradition to make bespoke notebooks and holiday cards for staff and clients. And as the team's sole visual designer with a print design background, the execution of these often came down to me â€“ much to my delight.
