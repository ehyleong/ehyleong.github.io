intro: A cheeky checklist for curious clients
byline: At Steamclock, we got a lot of requests for mobile apps. But not every business needs one – so we made a simple microsite to help prospective clients (and non-clients) figure out if they really need a mobile app, via a fun & interactive checklist.

			<h5>Goals</h5>
			<p>Our goals for this microsite were fairly simple: we wanted to create a small marketing campaign that was fun, memorable, and shareable – geared towards Steamclock's target demographic of CTOs of growing companies. While it could exist standalone, it was also meant to be an extension of the Steamclock's brand values – high quality, playful, nice – which informed the overall playful yet polished look throughout.</p>

			<h5>Outcome</h5>
			<p> The end result was a microsite that was cheeky and a bit contrarian, but still useful as a tool in the end of the day. Overall, the project was a success: people loved it! New clients have referenced it while reaching out, and we even use it to screen our in-bound leads too.</p>

			<h5>A note on tools</h5>
			<p>I designed and prototyped the website from wireframes to high-fidelity visuals, along with initial illustrations, using Figma. For some added delight and polish, I used a super combo of Figma, Illustrator, and After Effects to make a Lottie animation for each checklist item.</p>
