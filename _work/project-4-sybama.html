role: Website Design, Illustration, Animation
link: true
linktext: Visit Microsite
href: https://shouldyoubuildamobile.app
intro: We made a silly microsite for clients who don't need an app, but think they do.
byline: Most clients think they need a mobile app, when in fact they do not. As part of Steamclock's marketing, we made a microsite to help clients figure out if they need an app via interactive checklist.
