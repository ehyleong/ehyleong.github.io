  quote: Erica was employee &#35;1 at Assembly Co. That number is indicative of both when we hired her, as well as her importance to the organization as she grew with us from a junior designer to what I’d now consider a very capable design lead on any project.

  quote: While the term “multi-disciplinary” is a handle commonly applied to many designers nowadays, I’ve rarely seen such a shining example of the title. Erica’s toolbox of skills overflows with variety — and a demonstrated ability to execute makes her remarkably well-rounded.

  quote: Not having a firm idea on what I wanted for a logo, Erica was able to ask probing and clarifying questions to get me a logo and design I'm proud to display for my business. She was patient and understanding that I had very little knowledge on the spectrum of logo design, and the experience as such was overwhelmingly great.
