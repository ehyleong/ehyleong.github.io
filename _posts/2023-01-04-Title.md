If you have a strong fear of rejection, developing apps might not be for you.

Apple’s App Store review team rejects apps pretty regularly. Resolving the underlying issue usually isn’t a big deal, but every once in a while, and generally when a deadline is looming, Apple’s decision won’t have a clear fix.

“We noticed that your app supports account creation but does not include an option to initiate account deletion that meets all the requirements…. The process for initiating account deletion must provide a consistent, transparent experience for App Store users.”

Seems reasonable – but what exactly does App Review consider sufficiently consistent and transparent?
