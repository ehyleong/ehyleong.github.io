Chances are you’ve heard of the common adage, “share work, early and often.” The benefits are clear: sharing in-progress work early on allows teams to get on the same page and avoid surprises or wasted work. Easy win, right? A lot of teams find it easier said than done.

<h3 class="top-text-spacer">The Bumpy Beginnings</h3>

You might’ve heard that Steamclock has a culture of focusing on quality and polish. This has led, on occasion, to us taking things too far – or, relatedly, jumping to polish too early. In the early days for instance, we sometimes ran into situations where a designer would take a concept, dive straight into a rabbit hole, get sidetracked by the allure of polish, and eventually emerge with a proposal weeks later that was totally out of scope. Suffice it to say, we’ve learned some hard lessons.

So, why is it hard to present work while it’s still rough? On a personal level, it can feel uncomfortable — vulnerable even — to present work that hasn’t achieved our personal threshold of polish. Or, if you’re anything like the designer writing this blog post, you might be so enthusiastic about exploring a particular idea and getting straight to iterating, that you forget to check whether you’re even on the right track, or whether there are other, potentially better ideas that are worth considering. Oops. 😬

But there are ways a team can make things harder too. In our early days, our team hadn’t yet created a consistent workflow for presenting in-progress work, nor a regular schedule for checking in. Sure, we had Slack channels for each project, not to mention Github issues for each task, but requests for feedback on either avenue could get lost in the sea of messages we’d go through daily. We had syncs for each project, but thoughtful design reviews tended to get pushed out of these cross-team meetings.

When we did get around to discussing design feedback, we would often find ourselves getting pulled into a long, prescriptive, or occasionally ambiguous feedback loop. “Make this bigger” / “this isn’t working” / “I don’t want to say make it pop, but…” What we really needed was feedback that was more driven by goals and principles, setting people up to do great work more independently.
