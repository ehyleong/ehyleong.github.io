Howdy! Thanks for bothering to pay my humble site a visit. 

This digital baby is <strong>still a work-in-progress</strong> (as with 99% of design portfolios, let's be real), so please be gentle. Weirdly, in all the years I've been a designing in my career, it's the furthest I've gotten to publishing my work online – outside of like, <a href="https://dribbble.com/ehyleong" class="inline-link" target="blank">Dribbble</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/ehyleong" class="inline-link" target="blank">Instagram</a>. I plan to continue on iterating as time progresses – so if it looks like the paint colours have changed or like the furniture has been moved around, you know why.

It still remains to be seen what I end up doing with this blog section, but I hope to use it as a space to share things like: candid thoughts, neat finds, peeks into my process, and work that's more rough around the edges or not large enough to be its own full-blown case study. That's the dream anyway. 

If there's anything in particular you'd like to see, or you'd like to offer some notes of feedback, feel free to slide into my DMs on our favourite hellsite <a href="https://twitter.com/ehyleong" class="inline-link" target="blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://https://mastodon.cloud/@ehyleong/" class="inline-link" target="blank">Mastodon</a>, or <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" class="inline-link">e-mail</a>. In the meantime: stay tuned! Toodles.
